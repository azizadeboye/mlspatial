Description: This R package designed for the integration, visualisation, and modelling of spatial epidemiological data based on the method described in <https://github.com/azizadeboye/Spatial-Machine-Learning>. It facilitates the analysis of geographic health data by combining modern spatial mapping tools with advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms. The package enables users to import and preprocess shapefiles and associated demographic or disease incidence data, generate richly annotated thematic maps, and apply predictive models (Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Regression) to identify spatial patterns and risk factors. The package is suited for spatial epidemiologists, public health researchers, and GIS analysts aiming to uncover hidden geographic patterns in health-related outcomes and inform evidence-based interventions.
